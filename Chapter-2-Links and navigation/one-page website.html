		<h2>Reviews</h2>
		<p>"It’s quite possible that “Dahmer”—despite brilliant performances from Nash, Peters, and the great Richard Jenkins as Dahmer’s father, Lionel—has no real justification for its own existence." - Rotten Tomatoes</p>
		<p>"It's a well-made show and served as a good distraction while I was working. But it was easy to look away at my work because the show just felt kind of gross and disturbing." - IGN
